# A set is an unordered collection of items. Every element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (which cannot be changed).
#
# Operators for Sets
# Sets and frozen sets support the following operators:
#
# key in set-example       # containment check
#
# key not in set-example   # non-containment check
#
# set-1 == set-2       # set-1 is equivalent to set-2
#
# set-1 != set-2       # set-1 is not equivalent to set-2
#
# set-1 <= set-2       # set-1is subset of set-2 set-1 < set-2     # set-1 is proper subset of set-2 set-1 >= set-2    # set-1is superset of set-2
#
# set-1 > set-2        # set-1 is proper superset of set-2
#
# set-1 | set-2        # the union of set-1 and set-2
#
# set-1 & set-2        # the intersection of set-1 and set-2
#
# set-1 – set-2        # the set of elements in set-1 but not set-2
#
# set-1 ˆ set-2        # the set of elements in precisely one of set-1 or set-2
#
