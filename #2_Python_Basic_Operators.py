# Assume variable a = 10 and variable b = 20
#   Operator	    Description	Example
# + Addition	    Adds values on either side of the operator.	a + b = 30
# - Subtraction	    Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.	a â€“ b = -10
# * Multiplication	Multiplies values on either side of the operator	a * b = 200
# / Division	    Divides left hand operand by right hand operand	b / a = 2
# % Modulus	        Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder	b % a = 0
# ** Exponent	    Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators	a**b =10 to the power 20
# //Floor Division  The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed.
