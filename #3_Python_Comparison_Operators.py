# Operator	 Description	Example
# ==	       If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	(a == b) is not true.
# !=	       If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true.
# >	           If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a > b) is not true.
# <	           If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a < b) is true.
# >=	       If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a >= b) is not true.
# <=	       If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a <= b) is true.a=9

a=9
b=2

#Comparison Operation retus only boolen value (True/False)
